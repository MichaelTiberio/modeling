Simple file format for data files.

The file headers are plain text and can be parsed as CSV files, though the data contained in the
file may contain binary data as well.

Version 0.1

File format:
	1: {file_type},version={version}
	2: grid_source={grid_source}
	3: {grid_parameters}
	4: format={data_format},data_type={data_type},precision={precision},time_steps={time_steps},dt={dt}
	5:
	n: {data}

1: File Format - Metadata about the format of this file.
	{file_type} : The string "mctField" indicating that this file contains plot data.
	{version} : The string "0.1" indicating the version of the file format to follow.

2: Grid Source - How to load the grid data.
	{grid_source} : May be either of the two following options:
		- "CALCULATED" : Indicating that the grid can be calculated using the paramerters found in
		                 {grid_parameters}.
		- {grid_name} : Indicating the name of the grid data to load. The grid may be further
		                 parameterized by teh {grid_parameters} line.

3: Grid Parameters - A list of grid specific parameters that may be used to parameterize the grid.
   For example, a cartesian grid may expose delta-x and delta-y parameters to describe the physical
   spacing between columns and rows, respectively, of grid points. This way a cartesian grid can
   be designed that can be reused for multiple problems across different scales. The exact format
   of {grid_parameters} is grid specific and specified by the grid_source.

4: Plot Data Metadata
	{data_format} : The format of the contents of {data}. May be any of the following options:
		"csv" : The data is in CSV format.
	{data_type} : The type of data provided for each point. May be any of the following options:
		"float1" : One dimensional floating point value. Each grid point has a single value associted
			with it in the {data} section.
		"float2" : Two dimensional floating point value. Each grid point has two values associated with
			it in the {data} section.
		"float3" : Three dimensional floating point value. Each grid point has three values associated
			wiht it in the {data} section.
	{precision} : The number of decimal places the floating point values are rounded to before writing
		to file.
	{time_steps} : An integer that describes the number of time steps (rows) in the {data} section.
	{dt} : The time interval between time steps.

5: Blank Line

n: Plot Data - The data that describes the field to plot. Each row is an ordered list of data points
   that corresponds to the ordered list of grid points for the grid specified by {grid_source}.
   Each row corresponds to a single frame. The format of each datum is specified by {data_format}.
   The number of rows corresponds to {time_steps}.


2D Cartesian Grid Source
	{grid_source} : "CALCULATED"
	{grid_parameters} : algorithm={algorithm}, x_count={x_count}, y_count={y_count}, dx={dx}, dy={dy}
		{algorithm} : The string "cartesian2d" indicating that this field data is on a two dimensional,
			cartesian grid.
		{x_count} : An integer value indicating the number of colunns.
		{y_count} : An integer value indicating the number of rows.
		{dx} : A floating point value indicating the distance between colunns of grid points.
		{dy} : A floating point value indicating the distance between rows of grid points.
